#In this SQL project, I use a combination of different SQL commands from joining multiple tables to aggregating data from tables in order to answer questions about the data in the tables in the database.


1.Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT FirstName, Lastname, customerid, country FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE country <> 'USA';

2.Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, country FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE country = "Brazil";


3.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customers full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
on inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";


4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";


5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM chinook.invoices;


6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's' full name.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.InvoiceID
FROM chinook.employees as  emp
JOIN chinook.customers as cust ON emp.EmployeeID = cust.SupportRepId 
JOIN chinook.invoice as inv ON cust.CustomerID = inv.CustomerID; 


7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT cust.FirstName 'customer First' , cust.LastName 'customer last', cust.Country, emp.FirstName 'sales agent', emp.LastName 'sales agent', inv.Total
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId 
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerID;


8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId) FROM chinook.invoices
where InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name, inv.InvoiceLineID FROM chinook.tracks t 
JOIN chinook.invoice_items inv ON inv.TrackID = t.TrackID;


11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT ar.Name, track.Name, inv.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks track ON inv.TrackID = track.TrackId 
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a ON a.AlbumId = track.AlbumId 
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar ON a.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId;


12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name track_name , a.Title album_name, m.Name media_type, g.Name genre
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId 
JOIN chinook.media_types m ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId 
JOIN chinook.genres g ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId;


13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2)
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId 
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;


14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) Total_sales FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' AND inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY SUM(inv.Total) DESC LIMIT 1;
