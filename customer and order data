#In this SQL, I am quering a customer and order database with multiple tables in order to quantify statistics between the customers and the orders. 

--1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
where length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID;

--2. How many of those orders were for an iphone? 
SELECT COUNT(*), product FROM JanSales WHERE product = 'iPhone'; 

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT c.order_id, c.acctnum, f.Product FROM BIT_DB.customers c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales f 
ON c.order_id = f.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';



--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT orderID, Product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC limit 1;

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT sum(Quantity) * price as revenue, product, price, SUM(Quantity) FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, price, SUM(Quantity) AS total_quantity, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue,location FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE "%548 Lincoln%"
GROUP BY product;

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.acctnum), AVG(quantity * price), product FROM BIT_DB.FebSales f
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
ON c.order_id = f.orderID 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND f.quantity>2
AND orderid <> 'Order Id'
